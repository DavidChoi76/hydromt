Using a pre-defined Data Catalog
================================

The documentation contains a list of (global) datasets which can be used with various HydroMT models and workflows. 
The deltares_data catalog is only available within the Deltares network. However a selection of this data for a the 
Piave basin (north Italy) is available online and will be downloaded to ``~/.hydromt_data/`` if selected or when no data catalog is provided. 
Local or other datasets can also be included by extending the data catalog with new .yml files. 

Pre-defined Data Catalogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below are drop down lists with datasets per pre-defined data catalog for use with HydroMT. 
The summary per dataset contains links to the online source and available literature.
