               flood simulation. Here, we use machine learning to remove
               buildings and forests from the Copernicus Digital Elevation
               Model to produce, for the first time, a global map of elevation
               with buildings and forests removed at 1 arc second (∼30 m) grid
               spacing. We train our correction algorithm on a unique set of
               reference elevation data from 12 countries, covering a wide
               range of climate zones and urban extents. Hence, this approach
               has much wider applicability compared to previous DEMs trained
               on data from a single country. Our method reduces mean absolute

  abstract  = "Abstract Flood inundation modeling across large data sparse
               areas has been increasing in recent years, driven by a desire to
               provide hazard information for a wider range of locations. The
               sophistication of these models has steadily advanced over the
               past decade due to improvements in remote sensing and modeling
               capability. There are now several global flood models (GFMs)
               that seek to simulate water surface dynamics across all rivers
               and floodplains regardless of data scarcity. However, flood
               models in data sparse areas lack river bathymetry because this
               cannot be observed remotely, meaning that a variety of methods
               for approximating river bathymetry have been developed from
               uniform flow or downstream hydraulic geometry theory. We argue
               that bathymetry estimation in these models should follow
               gradually varying flow theory to account for both uniform and
               nonuniform flows. We demonstrate that existing methods for
               bathymetry estimation in GFMs are only accurate for kinematic
               water surface profiles and are unable to simulate unbiased water
               surface profiles for reaches with diffusive or shallow water
               wave properties. The use of gradually varied flow theory to
               estimate bathymetry in a GFM reduced model error compared to a
               target water surface profile by 66\% and eliminated bias due to
               backwater effects. For a large-scale test case in Mozambique
               this reduced flood extents by 40\% and floodplain storage by
               79\% at the 5 years return period. The wet bias associated with
               uniform flow derived channels could have significant
               implications for modeling the role floodplains play in
               attenuating river discharges, potentially overstating their
               role.",

                 development: scripts form transparent reproducible steps and
                 enable easy automation of many tasks. The Python scientific
                 ecosystem provides a wealth of open source libraries and make
                 Python particularly suited for model development. However, we
                 require additional tools to create reproducible large-scale
                 groundwater model projects.Handling the large scale -- iMOD
                 PythonRegional models in the Netherlands are characterized by
                 large size of input and output files; FloPy (Bakker et al.
                 2016) is not especially tailored to such use. We've built the
                 iMOD Python package on top of modern Python packages such as
                 xarray (Hoyer \& Hamman, 2017) to provide greater convenience
                 and performance. Xarray labels dimensions with coordinates for
                 geospatial datasets, supports out of memory computation, reads
                 and writes NetCDF files. The iMOD Python package
                 (https://gitlab.com/deltares/imod/imod-python) provides the
                 connection to model specific file formats (iMOD \& MODFLOW6)
                 and a number of additional utilities such as efficient
                 regridding, GIS operations, and visualization.Reproducible
                 projects -- Git, DVC \& SnakemakeOur goal is to make entire
                 model projects reproducible. Scripting succeeds in making
                 individual steps of the complex model development process
                 reproducible, but not completely. We use Snakemake (K{\"o}ster
                 \& Rahmann, 2012) as workflow manager to rally individual
                 scripts into an explicit workflow. Snakemake automatically
                 determines dependencies between the different steps, and will
                 detect which part of a workflow needs to be executed when e.g.
                 some input data or steps change. Code and data version control
                 keeps track of the history project. It functions as a log book
                 of past decisions, but also allows reverting the project to a
                 previous state with one command, which allows for an easy
                 comparison between the results of two versions of the project.
                 This is crucial for projects with a multiple-year duration
                 and/or projects with multiple contributors. Online code
                 repositories allow sharing of files, and further support
                 collaboration with issue boards and by making code
                 browsable.In this presentation we will present a reproducible
                 project of a regional model, using open-source tools. The
                 project is shared on Gitlab
                 (https://gitlab.com/deltares/imod/california\_model), where a
                 user can pull the code to their machine, using the version
                 control software Git (Chacon \& Staub, 2014). Consequently,
                 the user can fetch the data onto their machine with data
                 version control software DVC (https://dvc.org/). The complete
                 workflow from raw data to 3D images of the model output
                 heavily relies on iMOD Python and is executed with

  abstract  = "This paper describes the development of a new set of equations
               derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D storage cell
               inundation models where flows in the x and y Cartesian
               directions are decoupled. The new equation set is designed to be
               solved explicitly at very low computational cost, and is here
               tested against a suite of four test cases of increasing
               complexity. In each case the predicted water depths compare
               favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation results from
               the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al. (2005). For the
               most complex test involving the fine spatial resolution
               simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban area the
               Root Mean Squared Difference between the new formulation and the
               model of Hunter et al. is ~1cm. However, unlike diffusive
               storage cell codes where the stable time step scales with
               (1/??x)2, the new equation set developed here represents shallow
               water wave propagation and so the stability is controlled by the
               Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy condition such that the stable time step
               instead scales with 1/??x. This allows use of a stable time step
               that is 1-3 orders of magnitude greater for typical cell sizes
               than that possible with diffusive storage cell models and
               results in commensurate reductions in model run times. For the
               tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up achieved over
               a diffusive storage cell model was 1120??, although the actual
               value seen will depend on model resolution and water surface
               gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown to be
               grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have an
               intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small
               instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted
               when Manning's n=0.01. The new equations are likely to find
               widespread application in many types of flood inundation
               modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside
               more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk

               from catchment scale, national scale to continental and global
               scale. Wflow.jl is a free and open-source distributed hydrologic
               modelling framework written in the Julia programming language.
               The development of wflow\_sbm, the model structure, equations
               and functionalitities are described in detail, including example
               applications of wflow\_sbm. The wflow\_sbm model aims to strike
               a balance between low-resolution, low-complexity and
               high-resolution, high-complexity hydrologic models. Most
               wflow\_sbm parameters are based on physical characteristics or
               processes and at the same time wflow\_sbm has a runtime
               performance well suited for large-scale high-resolution model
               applications. Wflow\_sbm models can be set a priori for any
               catchment with the Python tool HydroMT-Wflow based on globally
               available datasets and through the use of point-scale
               (pedo)transfer functions and suitable upscaling rules and
               generally results in a satisfactory (0.4 $\geq$ Kling-Gupta

              meteorological variables and the Reliability Ensemble Averaging
              (REA) in our study applied to discharge statistics per basin. For
              basins with a strong climate signal, in Southern and Northern
              Europe, the consistency in the set of projections is large. For
              rivers in Central Europe the differences between models become
              more pronounced. Both weighting approaches assign high weights to
              single General Circulation Models (GCMs). The ClimWIP method
              results in ensemble mean weighted changes that differ only
              slightly from the non-weighted mean. The REA method influences
              the weighted mean more, but the weights highly vary from basin to
              basin. We see that high weights obtained through past good
              performance can provide deviating projections for the future. It
              is not apparent that the GCM signal dominates the overall change
              signal, i.e., there is no strong intra GCM consistency. However,

               of scaling related challenges that remain unsolved. In light of
               model result interpretation, finer resolution output might
               implicate to the user an increase in understanding of the
               complex interplay of heterogeneity within the hydrological
               system. Here we investigate spatial scaling in the realm of
               hyper-resolution by evaluating the streamflow estimates of the
               distributed wflow\_sbm hydrological model based on 454 basins
               from the large-sample CAMELS data set. Model instances were
               derived at 3 spatial resolutions, namely 3 km, 1 km, and 200 m.
               The results show that a finer spatial resolution does not
               necessarily lead to better streamflow estimates at the basin
               outlet. Statistical testing of the objective function
               distributions (KGE score) of the 3 model instances show only a
               statistical difference between the 3 km and 200 m streamflow

              Study focus Assessing water balance components in data-scarce
              regions using different approaches could result in different
              outcomes. In the upper reaches of the Citarum River in West Java,
              Indonesia, for example, many previous studies found the
              groundwater storage to be depleting, while GRACE identifies a
              contrasting trend of increasing groundwater storage change.
              Therefore, in this study, we aim to improve the accuracy of water
              balance components estimates in the Upper Citarum basin. Firstly,
              we estimate groundwater abstraction volumes based on population
              size and a review of literature. Estimates of the other water
              balance components, namely the rainfall, actual evaporation,
              discharge, and groundwater storage change are derived from
              various global datasets and available measurements. We also use a
              distributed hydrological model, wflow\_sbm, to yield additional
              estimates of discharge and actual evaporation. We compare each
              basin water balance estimate and quantify the uncertainty of some
              components using the Extended Triple Collocation (ETC) method.
              New hydrological insights for the region ETC application on four
              different rainfall estimates suggests a preference of using
              CHIRPS product in the study area as it delivers r2 of 0.56 and
              RMSE of 6.52 mm/day, compared to estimates from rainfall station
              (r2=0.39, RMSE = 8.57 mm/day), SACA\&D (r2=0.29, RMSE = 10.46
              mm/day), and TRMM (r2=0.56, RMSE = 8.61 mm/day). With CHIRPS
              rainfall forcing, wflow\_sbm model estimates of average daily
              actual evaporation and discharge are obtained. The results for
              actual evaporation (2.67 mm/day) are plausible with a narrow
              difference of less than 0.50 mm/day among other estimates. The
              simulated discharge results in a daily average of 5.38 mm/day,
              estimated between observation data (3.65 mm/day) and GloFAS-ERA5
              product (6.12 mm/day). Combining precipitation, actual
              evaporation, and discharge with a groundwater abstraction
              estimate of 0.57 mm/day, the wflow\_sbm-based groundwater storage
              change is estimated at a daily storage depletion of 0.82 mm/day.
              Using GLEAM actual evaporation estimates (3.13 mm/day) and
              observed daily discharge, on the other hand, results in surplus
              water of 0.45 mm/day for groundwater storage change. These
              results demonstrate the high uncertainty in capturing subsurface
              hydrological processes, although the groundwater storage change
              estimates are found close to the estimates based upon GRACE
              gravimetric satellite data of 0.25 mm/day, with a variance of
              1.57 mm/day. To aid in estimating current and future basin-scale
              groundwater level changes to support operational water management
              and policy in the Citarum basin, considering the massive
              groundwater abstraction, a focus on subsurface hydrological
              components quantification is of great importance for future

  abstract  = "Abstract. Coastal river deltas are susceptible to flooding from
               pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood drivers. Compound floods,
               which result from the co-occurrence of two or more of these
               drivers, typically exacerbate impacts compared to floods from a
               single driver. While several global flood models have been
               developed, these do not account for compound flooding. Local
               scale compound flood models provide state-of-the-art analyses
               but are hard to scale up as these typically are based on local
               datasets. Hence, there is a need for globally-applicable
               compound flood hazard modeling. We develop, validate and apply a
               framework for compound flood hazard modeling, which consists of
               the local high-resolution 2D hydrodynamic flood model SFINCS,
               which is automatically set up from global datasets and loosely
               coupled with a global hydrodynamic river routing and flood
               model, as well as a global surge and tide model to account for
               interactions between all drivers. To test the framework, we
               simulate two historical compound flood events, cyclones Idai and
               Eloise, in the Sofala province of Mozambique, and compare the
               flood extent to observations from remote sensing and to the
               global quasi 2D CaMa-Flood model. The results show that while
               the global and local model have similar skill in terms of the
               critical success index, they result in rather different flood
               maps. On the one hand, the local model has a higher hit ratio
               due to the representation of direct coastal and pluvial flooding
               (rain on grid) and a higher floodplain connectivity. It also
               shows a faster response to coastal drivers within the estuaries
               and more realistic flood depth maps. On the other hand, the
               local model has a higher false alarm ratio, which is partly
               explained by the inclusion of direct pluvial flooding without
               sufficient representation of small scale (subgrid) drainage
               capacity. To showcase a possible application of the framework,
               we also determine the dominant flood drivers and transition
               zones between flood drivers for both events. These vary
               significantly between both events because of differences in the
               magnitude of and time lag between the flood drivers. We argue
               that a wide range of plausible events should be investigated to
               get a robust understanding of compound flood interactions, which
               is important to understand for flood adaptation, preparedness,
               and response. As the model setup and coupling is automated,
               reproducible, and globally applicable, the presented framework
               is a promising step forward towards large scale compound flood
               hazard modeling.",

              parameter fields to the model resolution. The method was tested
              using a 6-hourly time step at four model resolutions (1.2, 2.4,
              3.6 and 4.8 km), followed by a validation with discharge
              observations and a comparison with actual evapotranspiration
              (ETact) estimates from an independent model (DMET LSA SAF).
              Additionally, the scalability of parameter fields and simulated
              fluxes was tested. Validation of simulated discharges yielded
              KGE-values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, except for the Alps where a
              volume bias caused lower performance. Catchment averaged temporal

              drainage densities. However, catchment averaged fluxes were
              better preserved. Routed discharge in headwaters was not
              consistent across scales, although simulations for the main Rhine
